Note: The camera angle for each activity (e.g., push-ups, skipping, etc.) should be fixed for optimal detection and accurate output.

Exercise Pose Analysis & Rep Counter
This repository contains Python scripts using MediaPipe Pose, OpenCV, and NumPy to monitor and count exercise repetitions from videos. The supported exercises include push-ups, squats, and rope jumping.

Scripts & Features
Filename	Exercise	Description
pushup_count.py	Push-ups	Counts push-up reps by analyzing elbow and shoulder positions.
squarts_count.py	Squats	Counts squat reps using knee joint angles and pose state logic.
rope_count.py	Rope Jumping	Tracks vertical hip centroid movement to count jumps.

Requirements
Python 3.7+

OpenCV (opencv-python)

MediaPipe (mediapipe)

NumPy (numpy)

Install dependencies:
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy

Usage
Update the video path inside each script (file_name or hardcoded path), then run:
python pushup_count.py
python squarts_count.py
python rope_count.py
Each script processes the video and displays the real-time exercise count overlayed on the video.

Details
pushup_count.py: Counts push-ups by detecting elbow bending relative to shoulders.
squarts_count.py: Uses angle calculations at knees to identify squatting and count reps.
rope_count.py: Uses hip landmark vertical centroid tracking and smoothing buffers to count rope jumps.

Customization
Modify video file paths to use your own videos.
Tune threshold values in each script to improve accuracy depending on your camera angle and exercise form.

Notes
Works best with single person videos.
Good lighting and clear side/front views improve detection.
Real-time processing may require decent hardware.
