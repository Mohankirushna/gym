🏋️‍♂️ Exercise Pose Analysis & Rep Counter 🏃‍♀️
This repository contains Python scripts using MediaPipe Pose, OpenCV, and NumPy to monitor and count exercise repetitions from videos. The supported exercises include push-ups, squats, and rope jumping.

📄 Scripts & Features
Filename	Exercise	Description
pushup_count.py	💪 Push-ups	Counts push-up reps by analyzing elbow and shoulder positions.
squarts_count.py	🏋️‍♀️ Squats	Counts squat reps using knee joint angles and pose state logic.
rope_count.py	🪢 Rope Jumping	Tracks vertical hip centroid movement to count jumps.

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.7+
OpenCV (opencv-python)
MediaPipe (mediapipe)
NumPy (numpy)

Install dependencies:
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy

▶️ Usage
Update the video path inside each script (file_name or hardcoded path), then run:
python pushup_count.py
python squarts_count.py
python rope_count.py
Each script processes the video and displays the real-time exercise count overlayed on the video.

📋 Details
pushup_count.py: Counts push-ups by detecting elbow bending relative to shoulders. 💪
squarts_count.py: Uses angle calculations at knees to identify squatting and count reps. 🏋️‍♀️
rope_count.py: Uses hip landmark vertical centroid tracking and smoothing buffers to count rope jumps. 🪢

⚙️ Customization
Modify video file paths to use your own videos. 🎥
Tune threshold values in each script to improve accuracy depending on your camera angle and exercise form. 🎯

💡 Notes
Works best with single person videos. 👤
Good lighting and clear side/front views improve detection. 💡
Real-time processing may require decent hardware. ⚡

📢 Important
Note: The camera angle for each activity (e.g., push-ups, skipping, etc.) should be fixed for optimal detection and accurate output. 🎥📐
